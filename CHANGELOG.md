## [Unreleased]

## [2.53.1] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- **SSRF guard no longer blanket-rejects IPv6 addresses on DNS64/NAT64 networks reaching public IPv4 servers.** A community user reported that every n8n API call started failing with `SSRF protection: IPv6 private address not allowed` after their environment switched to a resolver that synthesizes `AAAA` records via DNS64 — Node 17+ returns the synthetic `64:ff9b::<public-IPv4>` address first under default verbatim DNS ordering, and the previous blanket block on the `64:ff9b::/96` prefix rejected it. The IPv6 helper now inspects the canonical hextets of recognized tunneling prefixes and extracts the embedded IPv4, then applies the same `PRIVATE_IP_RANGES` and `CLOUD_METADATA` policy already enforced on plain IPv4 destinations. Supported layouts: NAT64 RFC 6052 well-known `64:ff9b::/96`; NAT64 RFC 8215 local-use at the `64:ff9b:1::/96` sub-prefix layout (parts[3..5] == 0) — RFC 8215 §3.1 recommends operators carve /96 sub-prefixes for IPv4 embedding, so this covers the realistic deployment; 6to4 RFC 3056 `2002::/16`; and Teredo RFC 4380 `2001::/32`. Tunneled private/metadata IPv4 — including the original GHSA-56c3-vfp2-5qqj payloads `64:ff9b::a9fe:a9fe`, `2002:a9fe:a9fe::`, and the equivalent loopback/RFC1918 embeddings — stays blocked. Tunneled public IPv4 (e.g. `64:ff9b::8.8.8.8`) is now allowed. Non-canonical shapes within the same prefix families — `64:ff9b:` outside the supported /96 layouts (including the literal RFC 6052 /48 embedding that interleaves the IPv4 around a u-octet at bits 64-71), and any 6to4/Teredo we don't recognize — fail safe and are blocked. Tunneled cloud-metadata and non-canonical tunneling shapes are now gated in **every** security mode (including permissive), restoring the "metadata blocked in all modes" promise and the fail-safe stance for unknown wire formats. IPv6 parsing is delegated to `ipaddr.js` (already a transitive dependency via `express → proxy-addr`, now promoted to a direct dep at the same `^1.9.1` version, so the install footprint is unchanged). Reported by Luca M.

## [2.53.0] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- **Multi-tenant `shared` session strategy no longer terminates concurrent sessions for the same tenant (#783).** Previously, the eager same-instance session cleanup at the top of the HTTP `initialize` handler ran *before* the configured `MULTI_TENANT_SESSION_STRATEGY` was consulted. When the strategy was set to `shared` — intended to let multiple MCP clients reuse the same tenant context concurrently — a second client's `initialize` for the same `x-instance-id` still wiped the first client's session, leaving the first client to fail subsequent requests with `Session not found or expired`. The cleanup is now gated behind `ENABLE_MULTI_TENANT=true && MULTI_TENANT_SESSION_STRATEGY=instance`, restoring the documented behavior of `shared`. The `instance` strategy is unchanged: same-tenant inits still replace prior sessions, which is the desired eager-cleanup semantic there. Two regression tests cover both branches. Reported and fixed by @LevSky22.
- **HTTP Streamable transport now returns `404` (not `400`) for terminated session IDs, per the MCP spec (#784).** The [MCP Streamable HTTP spec (2025-06-18)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#session-management) requires servers to respond with `404` when a request carries a valid-format `Mcp-Session-Id` that no longer maps to an active session — that's the client's signal to start a fresh session via `initialize`. The server previously responded with `400 Bad Request: Session not found or expired`, which spec-compliant clients (Claude Desktop, the MCP SDK) cannot distinguish from a genuinely malformed request, so they surface the error to the user instead of auto-reconnecting. The two affected sites (the TOCTOU window after the session-existence check, and the regular non-`initialize` fall-through) now return `404` with `Session not found or expired`. `400` is preserved for genuinely bad requests (missing session ID on a non-`initialize` request), and `202` is preserved for stale-session notifications (the anti-reconnect-storm path from #654). Reported and fixed by @LevSky22.
- **`n8n_get_workflow` no longer exceeds Claude Code's per-tool result cap on active workflows (#777).** n8n's draft/publish model returns a nested `activeVersion` object on every workflow GET, duplicating the live graph's `nodes` and `connections` alongside the draft. On the ~50% of workflows that are active, this pushed responses past Claude Code's default 25 000-token MCP cap, so the host persisted the result to a `/var/folders/...` file the model's sandboxed Bash couldn't read — effectively breaking the tool for any non-trivial workflow. `handleGetWorkflow` (mode `full`) and `handleGetWorkflowDetails` (mode `details`) now strip the heavy `activeVersion` payload while preserving the lightweight `activeVersionId` pointer, cutting response size roughly in half. As a defense-in-depth layer for genuinely huge workflows, the `n8n_get_workflow` tool definition now carries `_meta["anthropic/maxResultSizeChars"]: 450000` to opt the tool above the default cap (per the [Claude Code MCP spec](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp#raise-the-limit-for-a-specific-tool)) — the value sits below the protocol's 500k-char ceiling to leave headroom for the MCP/JSON-RPC envelope. `UIAppRegistry.injectToolMeta` was switched from assignment to a spread-merge so per-tool `_meta` keys (like the size override) are preserved when UI metadata is injected. Reported by @nepalez.

### Added

- **`n8n_get_workflow` gains `mode='active'` for inspecting the published graph.** Because n8n's editor saves a draft separately from the published/running version, callers that need to reason about what is actually executing (rather than what is being edited) now have a dedicated mode. The response is single-shaped — `nodes` and `connections` are populated from `activeVersion`, with `activeVersionId`, `versionCreatedAt`, and `versionName` exposed at the top level. `versionCreatedAt` is the version row's creation timestamp (within ~1s of the publish event in current n8n; we don't claim they're identical). On older n8n versions without the draft/publish split, the mode falls back to `workflow.nodes` when `active: true` so the mode stays usable across n8n versions; `NO_ACTIVE_VERSION` is returned only for inactive workflows that were never published. Type-safe support for the new fields was added to the `Workflow` interface as `ActiveWorkflowVersion`.

## [2.52.0] - 2026-05-13

### Changed

- **Updated n8n dependencies to 2.20.x.** `n8n-nodes-base` 2.18.3 → 2.20.4, `n8n-core` 2.18.3 → 2.20.3, `n8n-workflow` 2.18.3 → 2.20.0, `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain` 2.18.3 → 2.20.4. Pinned exactly (no caret) so a fresh `npm install` after a future minor release of any of these packages can't slip in a different node set than `data/nodes.db` was rebuilt against — `scripts/update-n8n-deps.js` now writes exact pins for the same reason. Database rebuilt against the new packages; community node rows preserved across the rebuild.
- **`get_node` (essentials/standard detail) `version` field is now a number, not a string** *(behavior change for all callers, not just community nodes)*. Previously the value came straight from the SQLite `version` TEXT column (`"1"`, `"2.3"`); it is now coerced to a finite JS number (`1`, `2.3`) so it can be assigned directly as `typeVersion` in workflow JSON. Callers that did `.startsWith()`, regex matching, or string comparison on the field need to coerce themselves or update to numeric handling. The `versionNotice` string is unchanged.

### Fixed

- **Community nodes: stop advertising npm package version as `typeVersion` (#781).** For community nodes, `get_node` previously returned the npm package version (e.g. `"0.2.21"`) in the `version` field and emitted `versionNotice: "Use typeVersion: 0.2.21 when creating this node"`. The advertised value is not a valid JS number — assigning `typeVersion: 0.2` produced workflows that n8n's runtime rendered as red/broken nodes even though both `validate_workflow` and `n8n_validate_workflow` reported them as valid. The community-node parser no longer falls back to the npm package version when the descriptor's version is missing (Strapi path) and never seeds the npm version as `typeVersion` (npm-only path); both default to `1`, which is what declarative community nodes register at runtime. The `get_node` response, for community nodes, surfaces `isCommunity: true`, `npmVersion`, a community-aware `versionNotice`, and a `metadata.versionCoerced` audit field whenever stale seed data has to be resolved on the fly. The shipped `data/nodes.db` is migrated in place: 118 community rows whose stored `version` was a multi-dot semver or contained letters were reset to `'1'`. `WorkflowValidator.validateAllNodes` now rejects non-finite typeVersions (including `NaN`) with an explicit "must be a finite non-negative number" message, parses comma-separated and array-form `nodeInfo.version` strings before min/max comparisons, falls back to suggesting `typeVersion: 1` when the database version is unparseable, and emits a "Cannot validate typeVersion" warning when stored seed data is unparseable so callers know the min/max checks were skipped rather than silently passed. Reported by @czlonkowski.

## [2.51.3] - 2026-05-11

### Security

- Fix workflow-telemetry URL path and query-string leak (GHSA-f3rg-xqjj-cj9w). `WorkflowSanitizer` previously replaced only the hostname of `url`, `endpoint`, and `webhook` field values with `[domain]` and left the path and query string intact, allowing customer IDs in URL paths, tenant identifiers, signed-request parameters, and tokens shorter than the 20-character generic-token threshold to reach the `telemetry_workflows` and `workflow_mutations` Supabase tables. `sanitizeObject` now fully redacts URL-named fields to `[REDACTED_URL]` regardless of value type, the dead hostname-only branch in `sanitizeString` is removed, and `event-validator.ts` replaces `nodes: z.array(z.any())` with a `.strict()` per-node schema that rejects unknown top-level node keys as defense-in-depth. The mutation telemetry path (`sanitizeWorkflowRaw`) shares the same code path and is fixed automatically. Reported by @u-ktdi.

### Notes

- **Telemetry output format changed.** Anyone consuming the local telemetry analytics will see `[REDACTED_URL]` in place of the previous `https://[domain]/<path>?<query>` and `[REDACTED_URL_WITH_AUTH]` placeholders for `url`, `endpoint`, `webhook`, and similarly-named fields. Pattern-specific placeholders (`[REDACTED_SUPABASE_URL]`, `[REDACTED_N8N_HOST_URL]`, `[REDACTED_WEBHOOK]`, etc.) still apply to free-text node parameters that happen to contain those URLs (e.g. `jsCode`, `systemMessage`).
- The webhook short-circuit in `sanitizeString` (returns `https://[webhook-url]` when a string value contains `/webhook/` or `/hook/`) remains for non-URL-named fields whose value embeds a webhook URL.

## [2.51.2] - 2026-05-11

### Security

- Fix silent env-credential fallback in multi-tenant HTTP mode (GHSA-jxx9-px88-pj69). When `ENABLE_MULTI_TENANT=true`, requests that omitted the `x-n8n-url` and `x-n8n-key` headers fell through to the process-level `N8N_API_URL` / `N8N_API_KEY`, letting one authenticated MCP tenant operate on the operator's n8n instance. Both paths now fail closed: the HTTP edge rejects header-less multi-tenant requests with `400 Multi-tenant headers required`, and `getN8nApiClient` refuses to construct an env-fallback client when `ENABLE_MULTI_TENANT=true`. Single-tenant mode is unchanged. Reported by @u-ktdi.

## [2.51.1] - 2026-05-06

### Security

- **Hardened `WorkflowSanitizer` (telemetry workflow ingestion) against new secret and PII categories (#779).** Added regex coverage for OpenAI `sk-proj-` / OpenRouter `sk-or-`, Stripe, GitHub PATs, GitLab, Hugging Face, Notion, GoHighLevel, Slack, AWS access key IDs, generic JWTs, Supabase secret/publishable keys, self-hosted n8n hostnames, and Supabase project URLs — all with type-aware placeholders (`[REDACTED_LLM_API_KEY]`, `[REDACTED_SUPABASE_KEY]`, `[REDACTED_STRIPE_KEY]`, `[REDACTED_API_TOKEN]`, `[REDACTED_JWT]`, `[REDACTED_N8N_HOST_URL]`, `[REDACTED_SUPABASE_URL]`). Added email and phone redaction for free-text node parameters (`systemMessage`, `text`, `html`, `prompt`, …). Made the generic 20-31 / 32+ char fallbacks idempotent via a `(?!REDACTED)` negative lookahead and dropped the early-break in `sanitizeString` so strings with secrets matching different patterns get every match redacted. Tightened the Bearer regex to stop at common string delimiters (quotes, commas, semicolons, closing brackets) so `auth: 'Bearer <token>'` no longer eats the closing quote. Tightened the phone regex with digit/hyphen lookbehind/lookahead so UUIDs and other hex-with-hyphen IDs aren't misclassified as phone numbers.

## [2.51.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- **`n8n_manage_credentials` now reports which workflows reference each credential.** Pass `includeUsage: true` to `action: "list"` or `action: "get"` to attach a `usedIn: [{id, name, active}]` array and a `usageCount` to every credential. The reverse index is built client-side by scanning workflows (n8n's public API has no native lookup), deduplicated per workflow, and capped at the same 5000-workflow limit `n8n_audit_instance` uses. Default behavior is unchanged — no extra API calls when the flag is omitted. If the workflow scan fails the response degrades to base credentials with a `usageScanError` field rather than failing the whole call.

## [2.50.5] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed

- **Advertise the Bearer auth scheme on `401` responses (#604).** HTTP-mode `/mcp`, `/sse`, and `/messages` now return an RFC 6750-compliant `WWW-Authenticate` challenge alongside the existing JSON-RPC `-32001` error body. Missing-credentials responses use `Bearer realm="n8n-mcp"` (no `error=` keyword, per RFC 6750 §3); rejected credentials use `error="invalid_request"` for non-Bearer schemes and `error="invalid_token"` for bad bearer secrets. Lets MCP scanners and OAuth-discovery clients distinguish "auth required" from "endpoint unreachable" without reading the JSON body. Originally authored by @voidborne-d (#767).

## [2.50.4] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed

- `n8n_list_workflows` and `n8n_executions` no longer fail with `VALIDATION_ERROR: Empty value found for query parameter` when MCP clients (e.g. opencode v1.14.35) serialize all schema fields — including optional ones — as empty strings. Optional string params (`cursor`, `projectId`, `workflowId`, `status`, `sortBy`, `search`) are now coerced to `undefined` before reaching the n8n API. Reported and diagnosed by @ale90bsas (#774).
- The same coercion is applied to `n8n_manage_datatable` (list/create/get-rows actions), `n8n_test_workflow`, and `n8n_trigger_webhook_workflow`, all of which had the same vulnerability surface from a broader audit.
- `serializeDataTableParams` in the n8n API client now also skips blank-string values as defense-in-depth.

## [2.50.3] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed

- `n8n_update_partial_workflow` now rolls back the prior workflow snapshot when n8n persists a body before failing (e.g. unsupported `typeVersion` trips the activation step inside the same PUT), preventing silent corruption of active workflows. Reported and originally fixed by @pybe (#769, closes #770).
- The rollback no longer fires (and no longer claims `(workflow restored to prior state)`) when n8n rejected the PUT before persisting. The handler now compares `versionId` / `versionCounter` / `updatedAt` from a fresh GET to detect whether persistence actually happened.
- Rollback-failure responses include `details.priorVersionId` so callers can recover the right snapshot via `n8n_workflow_versions`.

## [2.50.2] - 2026-05-04

### Security

- Fix SSRF in webhook URL validation (GHSA-cmrh-wvq6-wm9r). Reported by @fg0x0.

### Notes

- The n8n API client now validates `N8N_API_URL` through the same SSRF gate as user-supplied webhook URLs. Operators running n8n on the same host as n8n-mcp (`N8N_API_URL=http://localhost:5678` or an RFC1918 address) must set `WEBHOOK_SECURITY_MODE=moderate` (allows localhost, still blocks cloud metadata) to keep the API client functional after upgrade. Default `strict` is unchanged for production deployments with a public n8n URL.

## [2.50.1] - 2026-05-04

### Security

- Fix path-segment validation gap in n8n API client (GHSA-8g7g-hmwm-6rv2). Reported by @cybercraftsolutionsllc.
- Fix redirect-following on validated webhook, form, and chat trigger requests (GHSA-8g7g-hmwm-6rv2). Reported by @cybercraftsolutionsllc.
- Redact mutation telemetry payloads before storage (GHSA-8g7g-hmwm-6rv2). Reported by @cybercraftsolutionsllc.

## [2.50.0] - 2026-05-02

### Added

- **Local LLM support for template metadata generation.** `fetch:templates --metadata-only` now routes to any OpenAI-compatible server (vLLM, Ollama, llama.cpp's `/v1`) when `N8N_MCP_LLM_BASE_URL` is set, falling back to OpenAI's Batch API otherwise. New `SequentialMetadataProcessor` issues direct `chat.completions.create` calls with configurable concurrency, since vLLM and friends do not implement OpenAI's `/v1/batches` endpoint. New env vars: `N8N_MCP_LLM_BASE_URL`, `N8N_MCP_LLM_MODEL` (default `Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B`), `N8N_MCP_LLM_API_KEY` (defaults to `EMPTY` for keyless local servers), `N8N_MCP_LLM_CONCURRENCY` (default 40). The cloud Batch path is unchanged.
- **Stronger, leak-resistant prompt** for template metadata. The system message now spells out what each schema field means (categories, use_cases, required_services, key_features, target_audience) and explicitly forbids echoing prompt headers, which fixes a class of failures where smaller open-source models occasionally emitted `Template: ...` strings into the `categories` array. `createBatchRequest()` now delegates to `buildChatRequest()`, so the cloud Batch path picks up the new prompt too — both paths share the same body verbatim.

### Changed

- **Template store refreshed from n8n.io.** The templates table was rebuilt against the current API: 2,352 templates, 156 ranked node configurations across the most-popular nodes. Previous rebuild dated 2025-12-24.
- **Template metadata regenerated end-to-end** against a local Qwen3.5-9B vLLM instance: 2,351/2,352 templates carry fresh `metadata_json` (99.96% coverage). One template (4334) skipped due to a tokenizer encoding edge case in its source content.
- **Community node store refreshed** from the n8n Strapi verified list and the top-100 npm packages: **830 community nodes** (was 768, +62 new). Existing READMEs and AI summaries preserved through the upsert. Total nodes in DB: 1,650 (820 base + 830 community).
- **Community AI documentation summaries regenerated** against the same local Qwen3.5-9B instance: **825/830 nodes** with both `npm_readme` and `ai_documentation_summary` (99.4% coverage). The 5 misses are npm packages that publish no README on npmjs, so there is no source text to summarise.

### Notes

- Template fetch only drops the `templates` and `templates_fts` tables — never `nodes`. Community nodes were verified intact at 768 mid-run before the separate community refresh added the 62 new ones.
- A backup of the pre-fetch database lives at `/tmp/nodes-pre-template-update-20260502-093230.db` on the maintainer's machine.

## [2.49.0] - 2026-04-28

### Changed

- **Updated n8n to 2.18.4** (from 2.16.1). All four n8n packages bumped to the versions pinned by `n8n@stable`:
  - `n8n-nodes-base`: 2.16.0 → 2.18.3
  - `n8n-core`: 2.16.1 → 2.18.3
  - `n8n-workflow`: 2.16.0 → 2.18.3
  - `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain`: 2.16.1 → 2.18.3
  - Pins are now exact (no caret) to prevent npm from auto-resolving to `2.19.0`, which `n8n@stable` does not yet endorse and which would also force a different `zod` peer.
- **Bumped `zod` to 3.25.67** (from 3.24.1) to satisfy the new `zod` peer dependency declared by `n8n-core@2.18.3` and `n8n-workflow@2.18.3` — the same version `n8n@stable` itself depends on.
- **Rebuilt node database**: 1,588 nodes total — 820 core (675 from `n8n-nodes-base` + 145 from `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain`) + 768 community (668 verified + 100 from npm). Community READMEs refreshed via `generate:docs:readme-only` (763/768 with READMEs, 581/768 with AI summaries — the AI-summary backfill for newly-added community nodes runs separately via the local LLM step).
- **README badges and node counts updated** to reflect the new n8n version, node totals, and current passing-test count (`5,418`).

## [2.48.3] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- **Validator warning for `__rl` resourceLocator fields missing `cachedResultName` (#715, originally reported in #516 by @upsurge911-lgtm).** When a `__rl` field has `mode` and `value` but no `cachedResultName`, the workflow runs but the n8n UI shows "Choose..." in dropdowns and dependent metadata fetches (column lists, base names, etc.) never fire — users see "No columns found" with no obvious cause. Pre-fix the validator was completely silent on this. New `missing-cached-result-name` warning fires at `runtime`/`ai-friendly`/`strict` profiles (suppressed at `minimal`). The warning is gated to modes where the n8n UI renders a dropdown that displays the cached label (`id`, `list`, `name`) — modes with raw inputs (`expression`, `url`) are skipped to avoid false positives. The autofix half (live n8n API resolution + placeholder fallback) ships in a separate follow-up PR.

## [2.48.2] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- **`n8n_audit_instance` error message now distinguishes server-side from client-side failures (#736, reported by @waltho1123-cloud).** Pre-fix the warning was always `Built-in audit failed: <message>`, hiding HTTP status. The reporter's Zeabur deployment generates the `Invalid URL` string inside n8n's own audit code (likely from missing `N8N_PROTOCOL`/`N8N_HOST` env vars) and returned it as the response body — but the warning made it look like a client bug. Three new shapes: `endpoint not available` (404, unchanged); `Built-in audit failed (HTTP <status>): <reason>` for any other status; `Built-in audit failed (no response from n8n): <reason>` when no status was returned (timeouts, ECONNREFUSED). Also fixed a long-standing nit where the error path computed `builtinAuditMs` against `totalStart` instead of `auditStart`.
- **`n8n_manage_credentials` accepts `oAuth2Api` + `clientCredentials` payloads (#740, reported by @bwsnwl).** n8n's upstream Ajv schema for `oAuth2Api` has a known bug: the `if/then/else` on `useDynamicClientRegistration` uses `properties.x.enum` to test value, which evaluates true vacuously when the field is absent — so both `then` branches fire simultaneously and there is no payload shape that satisfies the schema for a plain `clientCredentials` grant. New `applyCredentialDataShims` helper normalizes the payload for that specific combination: strips `useDynamicClientRegistration` when falsy, injects `sendAdditionalBodyProperties: false`, `additionalBodyProperties: ''`, and `serverUrl: ''` (only when the DCR branch fires spuriously — explicit `useDynamicClientRegistration: true` callers are left alone so n8n surfaces real missing-field errors). Applied symmetrically on both create and update paths. Will be removed once n8n fixes the schema upstream.

## [2.48.1] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- **`n8n_update_partial_workflow` validateOnly path now matches the apply path (#744, reported by @Valirius).** Two interacting bugs:
  - **Path divergence:** `validateOnly: true` returned the structural-validation early-exit BEFORE `validateWorkflowStructure` ran. Reporters could see a green `valid: true` from validate-only and then fail the apply call with a structural error. The structural check now runs in both paths, and the validate-only response includes the same `structureErrors` the apply path would surface, plus a `valid` boolean that reflects post-diff structural validity. The diff engine's `validateOnly` return now carries the simulated post-diff `workflow` so the handler has something to validate against.
  - **Zod 4 record-key incompatibility:** Single-arg `z.record(valueSchema)` is reinterpreted by Zod 4 (bundled by `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`) as `z.record(keySchema=valueSchema)`, causing node-name strings like `"W-05b Set Context"` to fail with `_zod` / `Invalid key in record`. All `z.record` calls in `n8n-validation.ts` (`workflowNodeSchema.parameters`, `.credentials`, `workflowConnectionSchema`) and `handlers-n8n-manager.ts` (`createWorkflowSchema.connections`, `updateWorkflowSchema.connections`) now use the explicit two-arg `z.record(z.string(), valueSchema)` form which is unambiguous in both Zod 3 and Zod 4.

## [2.48.0] - 2026-04-28

Three validator/diff false-positive fixes that were blocking valid workflows from being authored or updated via the MCP tools.

### Fixed

- **`addConnection` no longer rejects multiple Switch outputs to the same target (#738, reported by @priyasogani8-star).** `validateAddConnection` was scanning every `sourceIndex` slot when checking for duplicates, so wiring Switch output 1 to a node that already had a connection from output 0 falsely failed with "Connection already exists". The check now resolves smart parameters (`branch`/`case`) the same way `applyAddConnection` does and only inspects the specific `(sourceOutput, sourceIndex)` slot. The error message now also includes the resolved index for clarity. Same change applied to `validateRewireConnection` to suppress duplicate sourceIndex warnings (validate + apply phases were both pushing them) — `resolveSmartParameters` gained an opt-in `silent` mode used only from validate.
- **`validate_workflow` no longer false-flags operations on community nodes with empty schema (#739, reported by @priyasogani8-star).** `EnhancedConfigValidator.validateResourceAndOperation` was emitting `Invalid operation "X" for node ...` for any non-empty operation value when the node was missing or had empty operation metadata. The puppeteer community node (and similarly indexed packages) ARE in the local DB but with empty `operations`/`properties_schema` columns, so `getNodeOperations()` returned `[]` and any explicit operation was rejected. Three new guards: top-of-method early-exit when `getNode()` returns null, plus per-field skips when the node has zero resource schema or zero operation schema globally. Real typos on KNOWN nodes (e.g. `operation: "sendMessage"` on Slack) still surface correctly.
- **`n8n_validate_workflow` no longer false-flags Code nodes with template literals or compact `}}` (#746, reported by @MarsSall).** `ExpressionFormatValidator.validateRecursive` walked into `jsCode`/`pythonCode` fields and fed the source to a bracket-balance check that miscounted `{{` vs `}}` on JS object literals like `[{json:{x:1}}]`. The validator now skips raw-code field keys (`jsCode`, `pythonCode`, `functionCode`) — mirrors the existing guard in `ExpressionValidator.validateParametersRecursive`. The skip applies wherever those keys appear in the parameters tree (top-level or nested).

## [2.47.14] - 2026-04-21

### Security

- Fix IPv6-mapped SSRF bypass in synchronous URL validation (GHSA-56c3-vfp2-5qqj, CVSS 8.5 High). `SSRFProtection.validateUrlSync` now rejects IPv4-mapped IPv6 (`::ffff:169.254.169.254`, `::ffff:127.0.0.1`, etc.) and private IPv6 addresses, matching the async webhook validator. The sync gate is the sole SSRF check in the SDK embedder path (`validateInstanceContext` → `getN8nApiClient`), so the bypass enabled cloud metadata access and `x-n8n-api-key` leakage for callers of `N8NDocumentationMCPServer` / `N8NMCPEngine` with user-supplied `InstanceContext`. Reported by @manthanghasadiya.

## [2.47.12] - 2026-04-17

Batch of ten fixes from the 2026-04-16 staging QA regression (release-blockers and polish items shipped together).

### Fixed

- **`get_node` version modes no longer return `upgradeSafe: true` with no data (QA #1 + #12, HIGH).** `versions`, `compare`, `breaking`, and `migrations` modes now check whether version metadata is populated for the node before computing their booleans. When metadata is missing, they return `{ available: false, reason: "Version metadata not populated…" }` instead of a confidently-zero response. Agents that previously saw `upgradeSafe: true` for a known-breaking HTTP Request v1 → v4 upgrade will now get an explicit "no data" signal. `getVersionSummary` also falls back to the node row's `version` field so `detail: standard` no longer reports `currentVersion: "unknown"` while `isVersioned: true` in the same response.
- **`rewireConnection` no longer silently corrupts the connection map (QA #7, HIGH).** `applyRewireConnection` now resolves `source` / `from` / `to` to concrete node objects up front, passes resolved names through to the inner remove/add calls, skips the add when `to` is already a target of `source` (previously caused a duplicated edge), and asserts an edge-count invariant that throws if the rewrite would leave the graph in an inconsistent state. Added regression tests for name-based rewire, ID-based rewire, and rewire-to-already-connected-target.
- **`search_templates` `by_metadata` returns `available: false` when metadata is missing (QA #11, HIGH).** Previously returned an empty `items: []` that callers couldn't distinguish from "no matches". Now returns `{ available: false, reason: "Template metadata has not been enriched yet…" }` when no templates have `metadata_json` populated, and `available: true` on hits. Callers get an actionable signal to fall back to `keyword`, `by_nodes`, or `patterns`.
- **`search_templates` `by_task: webhook_processing` no longer returns schedule/form-triggered templates (QA #2, MEDIUM).** Removed `n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest` from the `webhook_processing` task mapping. HTTP Request is not a trigger, so its presence matched any workflow that used outbound HTTP — including schedule and form triggered ones. Now matches only workflows that include the webhook trigger node.
- **QA #3 (MEDIUM) — deferred.** An initial attempt to reject invalid `operation` values in `NodeSpecificValidators.validateSlack` used a hardcoded resource→operations map, which turned out to disagree with the actual Slack node's schema (ironically, `post` — the value the QA report flagged as "silently accepted" — is a real Slack message op in n8n). Rather than ship a regression that rejects valid configs, the hardcoded list was removed and the issue deferred until the validator can derive the allowed set from the node's loaded `properties_schema`.
- **`moveNode` no longer silently mutates state when the wrong param name is passed (QA #6, MEDIUM).** `validateMoveNode` now catches the common `newPosition` typo with a "did you mean 'position'?" message *before* mutation, and also validates that `position` is a 2-element numeric array. Previously the operation set `node.position` to `undefined` and only failed at the final workflow-shape check with a cryptic `position Required` error.
- **`n8n_autofix_workflow` webhook path UUID is now stable across preview and apply (QA #4, LOW).** Previously each call generated a fresh `crypto.randomUUID()`, so the path shown in preview didn't match the path applied to the workflow. The UUID is now derived deterministically via UUID v5 (SHA-1-based per RFC 4122) from `workflow.id + node.id`, so preview and apply always agree. Downstream systems pre-configured against the preview value will now receive the same path.
- **`n8n_update_partial_workflow` activate/deactivate ops are now mutually exclusive (QA #8, LOW).** A batch like `[activateWorkflow, deactivateWorkflow]` previously returned `active: true` because the first op's flag was never cleared. The appliers now clear the opposite flag so last-op-wins semantics apply.
- **`n8n_update_partial_workflow` tool description now documents `patchNodeField` parameters inline (QA #5, LOW).** Added `fieldPath (dot path, e.g. "parameters.jsCode") and patches: [{find, replace}]` to the short tool description so agents can construct the operation without an extra `tools_documentation` round-trip.
- **`n8n_manage_datatable` `deleteRows` dryRun no longer returns a null "after" row (QA #10, LOW).** Stripped entries with `dryRunState: "after"` from delete responses — those rows always had every field null because there is no "after" state for a delete, and they surfaced as noise. Update/upsert dryRun responses are unchanged.

Conceived by Romuald Członkowski - https://www.aiadvisors.pl/en

## [2.47.10] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **`projectId` parameter on `n8n_manage_datatable` `createTable` (Issue #731, reported by @nesl247).** Tables can now be created directly in a specific n8n project instead of always landing in the default/personal project. The n8n public API (`POST /data-tables`) already accepts `projectId` as an optional body field — it was never wired through the MCP tool. `projectId` is threaded through the tool inputSchema, the Zod `createTableSchema`, and the `createDataTable` API client signature, matching the existing pattern on `n8n_create_workflow`. Workflows in team projects that rely on project-scoped data tables (e.g. queue-based processing) can now be fully automated via MCP.

### Changed

- **`columns` is now required (at least one) for `n8n_manage_datatable` `createTable`.** Previously the tool schema marked `columns` as optional, but the underlying n8n API rejects the call with `VALIDATION_ERROR: request/body must have required property 'columns'`. The Zod schema now enforces `.min(1, 'At least one column is required')` so the failure surfaces at the MCP boundary with a clear message instead of an opaque 400 from the API round-trip. Tool inputSchema description, `keyParameters`, `full.description`, parameter docs, and pitfalls are all updated to match.

### Fixed

- **Removed incorrect pitfall claiming `projectId` could not be set via the public API** in `n8n_manage_datatable` tool docs. The n8n API has always supported it; this documentation was misleading agents into manual UI workarounds.

## [2.47.9] - 2026-04-16

### Changed

- **Update n8n to 2.16.1.** Bumped `n8n-nodes-base` 2.15.0 → 2.16.0, `n8n-core` 2.15.0 → 2.16.1, `n8n-workflow` 2.14.1 → 2.16.0, and `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain` 2.14.1 → 2.16.1. These are exact-pinned to match the coherent dependency set that ships with n8n 2.16.1, since the individual packages' `latest` dist-tags on npm lag behind the meta-package release (e.g. `n8n-workflow@latest` is 2.13.1 while n8n 2.16.1 actually pins 2.16.0).
- **Rebuilt node database.** 1,505 nodes total: 812 core (675 from `n8n-nodes-base` + 137 from `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain`) and 693 community nodes (605 verified, 88 unverified). Community nodes preserved incrementally across the rebuild via backup/restore — 108 new READMEs fetched for nodes added since the last sync.
- **Updated README** n8n version badge (2.14.2 → 2.16.1) and node counts (1,396 → 1,505; 516 → 605 verified community).

## [2.47.8] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed

- **`n8n_create_workflow` / `n8n_update_full_workflow` failures from JSON-stringified array parameters (Issue #611, reported by @Mte90).** VS Code + GitHub Copilot and some other MCP clients serialize array/object tool arguments as JSON strings rather than native JSON types. This reliably affected workflows with 3+ nodes or complex nested parameters (e.g. `__rl` resource-locator objects, filter conditions), producing the error `"nodes must be an array, got string"` while 1-2 node payloads happened to slip through. The `n8n_update_partial_workflow` schema already preprocessed its `operations` field with `tryParseJson` (from the prior #600/#611 fix), but the create/update-full schemas did not — now they do. `nodes`, `connections`, and `settings` on both schemas, plus the `tags` filter on `n8n_list_workflows`, are wrapped with `z.preprocess(tryParseJson, ...)` so stringified JSON is parsed before Zod validation runs. The `tryParseJson` helper was relocated to sit next to its first usage rather than 2,400 lines below it.
- **Silent JSON parse failures in `coerceStringifiedJsonParams` now log a warning.** The top-level client-bug workaround in `server.ts` had two `catch {}` blocks that swallowed parse errors without trace, so malformed or truncated JSON from buggy MCP clients presented only as downstream Zod errors. Both catch blocks now emit a `logger.warn` with the parse error, a 200-char value preview, and the length — enough to diagnose serialization bugs without digging into transport-level logs.

## [2.47.7] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- **Multi-input Merge node false positive (Issue #721).** The strict validator hardcoded the Merge node's input count as 2, rejecting valid connections to inputs 2+ when `numberInputs` was set higher (e.g., combine mode with 4 inputs). The validator now reads the `numberInputs` parameter from the workflow node and skips input bounds checking entirely for non-Merge nodes, since many n8n nodes accept dynamic inputs that can't be determined from metadata alone.
- **Code node return validation false positive (Issue #721).** The validator flagged `return {status: "ok"}` as "Return value must be an array of objects" even in `runOnceForEachItem` mode, where n8n auto-wraps bare objects. The return-format checks now respect the Code node's `mode` parameter for both JavaScript and Python.
- **Controlled loop false positive (Issue #721).** Intentional pagination loops (e.g., HTTP Request → IF → Wait → HTTP Request) were flagged as "Workflow contains a cycle (infinite loop)" because the cycle detector only recognized SplitInBatches/Loop nodes as legitimate. It now also recognizes IF, Switch, and Filter nodes as conditional exit points that can bound a loop.
- **Expression bracket scanning in Code node fields.** The expression validator scanned `jsCode`, `pythonCode`, and `functionCode` fields for unmatched `{{ }}` brackets, producing false positives on ordinary JavaScript/Python curly braces. These raw code fields are now excluded from expression bracket validation.

## [2.47.5] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed

- **`npx n8n-mcp </dev/null` now exits promptly on stdin close (Issue #711, reported by @jbjardine).** The root cause was that the published bin entry was still `dist/mcp/index.js`, not `dist/mcp/stdio-wrapper.js`, so `IS_DOCKER=true npx -y n8n-mcp </dev/null` hit `index.js`'s container guard and stayed alive until SIGTERM arrived — breaking stateless stdio clients (e.g. `mark3labs/mcp-go`, MCPJungle) that close stdin to signal shutdown. The fix is to finally route the published bin through the wrapper (see below), which has always registered stdin handlers unconditionally. The container guard in `index.ts` is deliberately kept: Docker's detached-mode lifecycle (`docker run -d`) redirects stdin from `/dev/null` and relies on signals from `docker stop` for shutdown, not stdin close — the Docker entrypoint's root-switch path hardcodes `node /app/dist/mcp/index.js`, so the guard is load-bearing for every containerized deployment.
- **Published bin entry finally routes through `stdio-wrapper.js` (Issue #693, reported by @gjenkins20).** Commit bc191b0 (v2.45.1) updated `package.json`, `scripts/publish-npm.sh`, and `scripts/publish-npm-quick.sh` to route the bin through the stdio wrapper, but missed `.github/workflows/release.yml:375` which hardcoded the old path. Every CI release from v2.45.1 through v2.47.4 therefore shipped `bin: dist/mcp/index.js` — the fix never reached users. `release.yml` is now consistent with the other three sources, and a static test in `tests/unit/bin-consistency.test.ts` guards against the same drift recurring.
- **Telemetry CLI handler extracted to `src/telemetry/telemetry-cli.ts`** and called from both `src/mcp/index.ts` and `src/mcp/stdio-wrapper.ts`. This preserves `npx n8n-mcp telemetry enable|disable|status` (documented in `PRIVACY.md` and `README.md`) now that the published bin routes through the wrapper, and eliminates ~35 lines of duplication. The config manager is lazy-required so it stays off the stdio hot path when no CLI subcommand is present.

### Notes

- First-run telemetry banner is no longer printed on cold start via `npx n8n-mcp` because `stdio-wrapper.js` suppresses all `console.log` output before the server imports. This was already the behavior when users invoked the wrapper directly; it becomes user-visible now that the wrapper is the published bin. Run `npx n8n-mcp telemetry status` to see current telemetry state.
- Added `tests/integration/mcp/stdio-shutdown.test.ts` with 3 regression cases that spawn `dist/mcp/stdio-wrapper.js` (the published bin entry, matching the `npx` path) and assert exit-on-stdin-close / exit-on-SIGTERM within a 500ms budget, covering the exact Issue #711 repro.

No runtime behaviour change beyond what the individual fix comments document. All 4512 unit tests and 699 integration tests pass.
- Added linear-time `extractBracketExpressions()` / `hasBracketExpression()` helpers in `src/utils/expression-utils.ts` for validators that previously relied on lazy-quantifier regexes.
- `createCacheKey` in `src/utils/cache-utils.ts` now derives its output via a CodeQL-approved KDF with aggressive memoization. Semantically deterministic per-process, O(1) on cache hits.
- Chat trigger session ID format changed from `session_{timestamp}_{9-char-alnum}` to `session_{timestamp}_{UUIDv4}`. Accompanying test regex updated.

## [2.47.2] - 2026-04-07

### Changed

- **Dropped the `n8n` meta package from dev dependencies** — The MCP server only reads node metadata from a prebuilt SQLite database and never executes n8n workflows, so depending on the full n8n meta package (which pulls in the editor backend, task runner, queue, typeorm, AI workflow builder, bull, and ~440 other transitive packages) was pure overhead in the dev tree. Replaced with a direct dependency on `n8n-nodes-base`, which is what `src/loaders/node-loader.ts` actually `require()`s at rebuild time. Net result: **~440 fewer packages installed in the dev tree** with no change to runtime behavior or the published npm artifact (which already ships zero n8n deps via `package.runtime.json`).
- **Kept `n8n-core` as a direct dep** — Though our source code never imports it, `n8n-nodes-base` internally `require()`s `n8n-core` in several node files (Merge V3, Slack V2, and others), yet only declares it as a `devDependency`. Previously it was pulled in transitively by the `n8n` meta package; now that we depend on `n8n-nodes-base` directly we need `n8n-core` as an explicit dep so those nodes load during `npm run rebuild`.
- **`scripts/update-n8n-deps.js`** — Simplified to check each tracked package (`n8n-nodes-base`, `n8n-core`, `n8n-workflow`, `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain`) against its own `latest` dist-tag on npm, rather than deriving peer versions from the `n8n` meta package's dependency list.
- **`scripts/update-and-publish-prep.sh`** — Reads primary version from `n8n-nodes-base`.
- **`src/mcp/tools-documentation.ts`** — Compatibility notice now reads the tested n8n version from `n8n-nodes-base` in `package.json` instead of the removed `n8n` meta dep.

### Notes

- The SBOM generated by GitHub (scanned from `package.json`) will now show ~440 fewer packages in the dev tree.
- The published `n8n-mcp` npm package is unchanged — it uses `package.runtime.json` and has always shipped with zero n8n deps.
- No functional change to node loading: the full set of 812 base nodes (676 from `n8n-nodes-base` + 136 from `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain`) loads correctly, as verified by the integration test suite.

## [2.47.1] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed

- **Credential get fallback** — `n8n_manage_credentials({action: "get"})` now falls back to list + filter when `GET /credentials/:id` returns 403 Forbidden or 405 Method Not Allowed, since this endpoint is not in the n8n public API
- **Credential update accepts `type` field** — `n8n_manage_credentials({action: "update"})` now forwards the optional `type` field to the n8n API, which some n8n versions require in the PATCH payload
- **Credential response stripping** — `create` and `update` handlers now strip the `data` field from responses (defense-in-depth, matching the `get` handler pattern)

## [2.47.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- **`n8n_audit_instance` tool** — Security audit combining n8n's built-in `POST /audit` API (5 risk categories: credentials, database, nodes, instance, filesystem) with deep workflow scanning. Custom checks include 50+ regex patterns for hardcoded secrets (OpenAI, AWS, Stripe, GitHub, Slack, SendGrid, and more), unauthenticated webhook detection, error handling gap analysis, data retention risk assessment, and PII detection. Returns a compact markdown report grouped by workflow with a Remediation Playbook showing auto-fixable items, items requiring review, and items requiring user action. Inspired by [Audit n8n Workflows Security](https://wotai.co/blog/audit-n8n-workflows-security)
- **`n8n_manage_credentials` tool** — Full credential CRUD with schema discovery. Actions: list, get, create, update, delete, getSchema. Enables AI agents to create credentials and assign them to workflow nodes as part of security remediation. Credential secret values are never logged or returned in responses (defense-in-depth)
- **Credential scanner service** (`src/services/credential-scanner.ts`) — 50+ regex patterns ported from the production cache ingestion pipeline, covering AI/ML keys, cloud/DevOps tokens, GitHub PATs, payment keys, email/marketing APIs, and more. Per-node scanning with masked output
- **Workflow security scanner** (`src/services/workflow-security-scanner.ts`) — 4 configurable checks: hardcoded secrets, unauthenticated webhooks (excludes respondToWebhook), error handling gaps (3+ node threshold), data retention settings
- **Audit report builder** (`src/services/audit-report-builder.ts`) — Generates compact grouped-by-workflow markdown with tables, built-in audit rendering, and a Remediation Playbook with tool chains for auto-fixing

### Changed

- **CLAUDE.md** — Removed Session Persistence section (no longer needed), added OSS sensitivity notice to prevent secrets from landing in committed files
- **API client request interceptor** — Now redacts request body for `/credentials` endpoints to prevent secret leakage in debug logs
- **Credential handler responses** — All credential handlers (get, create, update) strip the `data` field from responses as defense-in-depth against future n8n versions returning decrypted values

### Security

- **Secret masking at scan time** — `maskSecret()` is called immediately during scanning; raw values are never stored in detection results
- **Credential body redaction** — API client interceptor suppresses body logging for credential endpoints
- **Cursor dedup guard** — `listAllWorkflows()` tracks seen cursors to prevent infinite pagination loops
- **PII findings classified as review** — PII detections (email, phone, credit card) are marked as `review_recommended` instead of `auto_fixable`, preventing nonsensical auto-remediation

## [2.46.1] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- **Fix SSE reconnection loop** — SSE clients entering rapid reconnection loops because `POST /mcp` never routed messages to `SSEServerTransport.handlePostMessage()` (Fixes #617). Root cause: SSE sessions were stored in a separate `this.session` property invisible to the StreamableHTTP POST handler
- **Add authentication to SSE endpoints** — `GET /sse` and `POST /messages` now require Bearer token authentication, closing an auth gap where SSE connections were unauthenticated
- **Fix rate limiter exhaustion during reconnection** — added `skipSuccessfulRequests: true` to `authLimiter` so legitimate requests don't count toward the rate limit, preventing 429 storms during SSE reconnection loops

### Changed

- **Separate SSE endpoints (SDK pattern)** — SSE transport now uses dedicated `GET /sse` + `POST /messages` endpoints instead of sharing `/mcp` with StreamableHTTP, following the official MCP SDK backward-compatible server pattern
- **Unified auth into `authenticateRequest()` method** — consolidated duplicated Bearer token validation logic from three endpoints into a single method with consistent JSON-RPC error responses
- **SSE sessions use shared transports map** — removed the legacy `this.session` singleton; SSE sessions are now stored in the same `this.transports` map as StreamableHTTP sessions with `instanceof` guards for type discrimination

### Deprecated

- **SSE transport (`GET /sse`, `POST /messages`)** — SSE is deprecated in MCP SDK v1.x and removed in v2.x. Clients should migrate to StreamableHTTP (`POST /mcp`). These endpoints will be removed in a future major release

### Security

- **Rate limiting on all authenticated endpoints** — `authLimiter` now applied to `GET /sse` and `POST /messages` in addition to `POST /mcp`
- **Transport type guards** — `instanceof` checks prevent cross-protocol access (SSE session IDs rejected on StreamableHTTP endpoint and vice versa)

## [2.46.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added

- **`patchNodeField` operation for `n8n_update_partial_workflow`** — a dedicated, strict find/replace operation for surgical string edits in node fields (Fixes #696). Key features:
  - **Strict error handling**: errors if find string not found (unlike `__patch_find_replace` which only warns)
  - **Ambiguity detection**: errors if find matches multiple times unless `replaceAll: true` is set
  - **`replaceAll` flag**: replace all occurrences of a string in a single patch
  - **`regex` flag**: use regex patterns for advanced find/replace
  - Top-level operation type for better discoverability

### Security

- **Prototype pollution protection** — `setNestedProperty` and `getNestedProperty` now reject paths containing `__proto__`, `constructor`, or `prototype`. Protects both `patchNodeField` and `updateNode` operations
- **ReDoS protection** — regex patterns with nested quantifiers or overlapping alternations are rejected to prevent catastrophic backtracking
- **Resource limits** — max 50 patches per operation, max 500-char regex patterns, max 512KB field size for regex operations

- **`n8n_generate_workflow` tool**: New MCP tool that enables AI-powered workflow generation from natural language descriptions. Available on the hosted service with handler delegation pattern for extensibility.

- **Handler injection API**: `EngineOptions.generateWorkflowHandler` allows hosting environments to provide custom workflow generation backends. Handler receives helpers for `createWorkflow`, `validateWorkflow`, `autofixWorkflow`, and `getWorkflow`.

- **Tool documentation**: Full essentials and deep documentation for `n8n_generate_workflow` via `tools_documentation`.

### Fixed

- **Tools documentation count**: Corrected n8n API tools count and added missing `n8n_manage_datatable` entry to tools overview.

## [2.42.3] - 2026-03-30

### Improved

- **Patterns response trimmed for token efficiency** (Issue #683): Task-specific patterns response reduced ~64% — dropped redundant `displayName`, shortened field names (`frequency` → `freq`), capped chains at 5, and shortened chain node types to last segment.

- **`patterns` mode added to `tools_documentation`**: Was missing from both essentials and full docs. AI agents can now discover patterns mode through the standard documentation flow.

- **`includeOperations` omission behavior documented**: Added note that trigger nodes and freeform nodes (Code, HTTP Request) omit the `operationsTree` field.

- **`search_nodes` examples trimmed**: Reduced from 11 to 6 examples in full docs, removing near-duplicates.

## [2.42.2] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- **`workflow-patterns.json` missing from npm package** (Issue #681): Added `data/workflow-patterns.json` to the `files` array in `package.json` so the patterns file is included in the published npm package and works out of the box without manual generation.

## [2.42.1] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- **Community nodes missing from database after rebuild**: Restored 584 community nodes from the n8n 2.13.3 snapshot and re-extracted operations with resource grouping from `properties_schema`. 366 community nodes now have proper resource-grouped operations.

- **Community node service missing resource extraction**: `extractOperations()` in `community-node-service.ts` was not extracting `resource` from `displayOptions.show.resource`, same issue that was fixed in `property-extractor.ts` in v2.42.0.

Conceived by Romuald Członkowski - https://www.aiadvisors.pl/en

## [2.42.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added

- **`includeOperations` flag for search_nodes**: Opt-in parameter that returns a resource/operation tree per search result, grouped by resource (e.g., Slack returns 7 resources with 44 operations). Saves a mandatory `get_node` round-trip when building workflows. Adds ~100-300 tokens per result.

- **`searchMode: "patterns"` for search_templates**: New lightweight mode that serves workflow pattern summaries mined from 2,700+ templates. Returns common node combinations, connection chains, and frequency data per task category (10 categories: ai_automation, webhook_processing, scheduling, etc.). Use `task` parameter for category-specific patterns or omit for overview.

- **Workflow pattern mining script** (`npm run mine:patterns`): Extracts node frequency, co-occurrence, and connection topology from the template database. Two-pass pipeline: Pass 1 analyzes `nodes_used` metadata (no decompression), Pass 2 decompresses workflows for connection analysis. Produces `data/workflow-patterns.json` with 554 node types, 3,201 edges, and 5,246 chains.

### Fixed

- **Operations extraction now includes resource grouping**: The property extractor was using `find()` to get only the first `operation` property, but n8n nodes have multiple operation properties each mapped to a different resource via `displayOptions.show.resource`. Changed to `filter()` to capture all operation properties. Slack went from 17 flat operations to 44 operations across 7 named resources.

- **FTS-to-LIKE fallback dropped search options**: When the FTS5 search fell back to LIKE-based search (e.g., for "http request"), the `options` object (including `includeOperations`, `includeExamples`, `source`) was silently lost. Now correctly passed through.

## [2.41.4] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- **`validate_workflow` misses `conditions.options` check for If/Switch nodes** (Issue #675): Added version-conditional validation — If v2.2+ and Switch v3.2+ now require `conditions.options` metadata, If v2.0-2.1 validates operator structures, and v1.x is left unchecked. Previously only caught by `n8n_create_workflow` pre-flight but not by offline `validate_workflow`.

- **False positive "Set node has no fields configured" for Set v3+** (Issue #676): The `validateSet` checker now recognizes `config.assignments.assignments` (v3+ schema) in addition to `config.values` (v1/v2 schema). Updated suggestion text to match current UI terminology.

- **Expression validator does not detect unwrapped n8n expressions** (Issue #677): Added heuristic pre-pass that detects bare `$json`, `$node`, `$input`, `$execution`, `$workflow`, `$prevNode`, `$env`, `$now`, `$today`, `$itemIndex`, and `$runIndex` references missing `={{ }}` wrappers. Uses anchored patterns to avoid false positives. Emits warnings, not errors.

## [2.41.3] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed

- **Session timeout default too low** (Issue #626): Raised `SESSION_TIMEOUT_MINUTES` default from 5 to 30 minutes. The 5-minute default caused sessions to expire mid-operation during complex multi-step workflows (validate → get structure → patch → validate), forcing users to retry. Configurable via environment variable.

- **Operations array received as string from VS Code** (Issue #600): Added `z.preprocess` JSON string parsing to the `operations` parameter in `n8n_update_partial_workflow`. The VS Code MCP extension serializes arrays as JSON strings — the Zod schema now transparently parses them before validation.

- **`undefined` values rejected in MCP tool calls from VS Code** (Issue #611): Strip explicit `undefined` values from tool arguments before Zod validation. VS Code sends `undefined` as a value which Zod's `.optional()` rejects (it expects the field to be missing, not present-but-undefined).

## [2.41.2] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed

- **MCP initialization floods Claude Desktop with JSON parse errors** (Issues #628, #627, #567): Intercept `process.stdout.write` in stdio mode to redirect non-JSON-RPC output to stderr. Console method suppression alone was insufficient — native modules (better-sqlite3), n8n packages, and third-party code can call `process.stdout.write()` directly, corrupting the JSON-RPC stream. Only writes containing valid JSON-RPC messages (`{"jsonrpc":...}`) are now allowed through stdout; everything else is redirected to stderr. This fixes the flood of "Unexpected token is not valid JSON" warnings on every new chat in Claude Desktop, including leaked `refCount`, `dbPath`, `clientVersion`, `protocolVersion`, and other debug strings.

Conceived by Romuald Członkowski - https://www.aiadvisors.pl/en

## [2.41.1] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed

- **If node operators silently fail at runtime** (Issue #665): Replaced incorrect operator names `isNotEmpty`/`isEmpty` with `notEmpty`/`empty` across all validators, sanitizer, documentation, and error messages. n8n's execution engine does not recognize `isNotEmpty`/`isEmpty` — unknown operators silently return `false`, causing If/Switch conditions to always take the wrong branch. Added auto-correction in the sanitizer so existing workflows using legacy names are fixed on update.

- **`addConnection` creates broken connections with `type: "0"`** (Issue #659): Fixed two edge cases where numeric `targetInput` or `sourceOutput` values leaked into connection objects as `"type": "0"` instead of `"type": "main"`. Numeric `targetInput` values are now remapped to `"main"`, and the `sourceOutput` remapping guard was relaxed to handle redundant `sourceOutput: 0` + `sourceIndex: 0` combinations. Also resolves Issue #653 (dangling connections after `removeNode`) which was caused by malformed connections from this bug.

- **`__patch_find_replace` corrupts Code node jsCode** (Issue #642): Implemented the `__patch_find_replace` feature for surgical string edits in `updateNode` operations. Previously, passing `{"parameters.jsCode": {"__patch_find_replace": [...]}}` stored the patch object literally as jsCode, producing `[object Object]` at runtime. The feature now reads the current string value, applies each `{find, replace}` entry sequentially, and writes back the modified string. Includes validation for patch format, target property existence, and string type.

### Improved

- Extracted `OPERATOR_CORRECTIONS` and `UNARY_OPERATORS` to module-level constants for better performance and single source of truth
- Added `exists`/`notExists` to unary operator lists for consistency across sanitizer and validator
- Fixed recovery guidance referencing non-existent `validate_node_operation` tool (now `validate_node`)

## [2.41.0] - 2026-03-25

### Changed

- **Updated n8n dependencies**: n8n 2.12.3 → 2.13.3, n8n-core 2.12.0 → 2.13.1, n8n-workflow 2.12.0 → 2.13.1, @n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain 2.12.0 → 2.13.1
- **Rebuilt node database**: 1,396 nodes (812 from n8n-nodes-base/langchain + 584 community: 516 verified + 68 npm)
- **Refreshed community nodes**: 584 total (up from 430), with 581 AI-generated documentation summaries
- **Improved documentation generator**: Strip `<think>` tags from thinking-model responses; use raw fetch for vLLM `chat_template_kwargs` support
- **Incremental community node updates**: `fetch:community` now upserts by default, preserving existing READMEs and AI summaries. Use `--rebuild` for clean slate

## [2.40.5] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed

- **Webhook workflows created via MCP get 404 errors** (Issue #643): Auto-inject `webhookId` (UUID) on webhook-type nodes (`webhook`, `webhookTrigger`, `formTrigger`, `chatTrigger`) during `cleanWorkflowForCreate()` and `cleanWorkflowForUpdate()`. n8n 2.10+ requires this field for proper webhook URL registration; without it, webhooks silently fail with 404. Existing `webhookId` values are preserved.

## [2.40.4] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed

- **Incorrect data tables availability info**: Removed "enterprise/cloud only" restriction from tool description and documentation — data tables are available on all n8n plans including self-hosted
- **Redundant pitfalls removed**: Removed "Requires N8N_API_URL and N8N_API_KEY" and "enterprise or cloud plans" pitfalls — the first is implicit for all n8n management tools, the second was incorrect

Conceived by Romuald Członkowski - https://www.aiadvisors.pl/en

## [2.40.3] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed

- **Notification 400 disconnect storms (#654)**: `handleRequest()` now returns 202 Accepted for JSON-RPC notifications with stale/expired session IDs instead of 400. Per JSON-RPC 2.0 spec, notifications don't expect responses — returning 400 caused Claude's proxy to trigger reconnection storms (930 errors/day, 216 users affected)
- **TOCTOU race in session lookup**: Added null guard after transport assignment to handle sessions removed between the existence check and use
- **`updateTable` silently ignoring `columns` parameter**: Now returns a warning message when `columns` is passed to `updateTable`, clarifying that table schema is immutable after creation via the public API
- **Tool schema descriptions clarified**: `name` and `columns` parameter descriptions now explicitly document that `updateTable` is rename-only and columns are for `createTable` only

Conceived by Romuald Członkowski - https://www.aiadvisors.pl/en

## [2.40.2] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed

- **Double URL-encoding of `filter` and `sortBy` in `getRows`/`deleteRows`**: Moved `encodeURIComponent()` from handler layer to a custom `paramsSerializer` in the API client. Handlers were encoding values before passing them as Axios params, causing double-encoding (`%257B` instead of `%7B`). Handlers now pass raw values; the API client encodes once via `serializeDataTableParams()`
- **`updateTable` documentation clarified**: Explicitly notes that only renaming is supported (no column modifications via public API)

Conceived by Romuald Członkowski - https://www.aiadvisors.pl/en

## [2.40.1] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed

- **`n8n_manage_datatable` row operations broken by MCP transport serialization**: `data` parameter received as string instead of JSON — added `z.preprocess` coercers for array/object/filter params
- **`n8n_manage_datatable` filter/sortBy URL encoding**: n8n API requires URL-encoded query params — added `encodeURIComponent()` for filter and sortBy in getRows and deleteRows (revised in 2.40.2 to move encoding to API client layer)
- **`json` column type rejected by n8n API**: Removed `json` from column type enum (n8n only accepts string/number/boolean/date)
- **Garbled 404 error messages**: Fixed `N8nNotFoundError` constructor — API error messages are now passed through cleanly instead of being wrapped in "Resource with ID ... not found"

## [2.40.0] - 2026-03-21

### Changed

- **`n8n_manage_datatable` MCP tool** (replaces `n8n_create_data_table`): Full data table management covering all 10 n8n data table API endpoints
  - **Table operations**: createTable, listTables, getTable, updateTable, deleteTable
  - **Row operations**: getRows, insertRows, updateRows, upsertRows, deleteRows
  - Filter system with and/or logic and 8 condition operators (eq, neq, like, ilike, gt, gte, lt, lte)
  - Dry-run support for updateRows, upsertRows, deleteRows
  - Pagination, sorting, and full-text search for row listing
  - Shared error handler and consolidated Zod schemas for consistency
  - 9 new `N8nApiClient` methods for all data table endpoints
- **`projectId` parameter for `n8n_create_workflow`**: Create workflows directly in a specific team project (enterprise feature)

### Breaking

## [2.38.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added

- **`transferWorkflow` diff operation** (Issue #644): Move workflows between projects via `n8n_update_partial_workflow`
  - New `transferWorkflow` operation type with `destinationProjectId` parameter
  - Calls `PUT /workflows/{id}/transfer` via dedicated API after workflow update
  - Proper error handling: returns `{ success: false, saved: true }` when transfer fails after update
  - Transfer executes before activation so workflow is in target project first
  - Zod schema validates `destinationProjectId` is non-empty
  - Updated tool description and documentation to list the new operation
  - `inferIntentFromOperations` returns descriptive intent for transfer operations
  - `N8nApiClient.transferWorkflow()` method added

Conceived by Romuald Członkowski - https://www.aiadvisors.pl/en

## [2.37.3] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed

- **updateNode `name`/`id` field normalization**: LLMs sending `{type: "updateNode", name: "Code", ...}` instead of `nodeName` no longer get "Node not found" errors. The Zod schema now normalizes `name` → `nodeName` and `id` → `nodeId` for node-targeting operations (updateNode, removeNode, moveNode, enableNode, disableNode)
- **AI connection types in disconnected-node detection** (Issue #581): Replaced hardcoded 7-type list with dynamic iteration over all connection types present in workflow data. Nodes connected via `ai_outputParser`, `ai_document`, `ai_textSplitter`, `ai_agent`, `ai_chain`, `ai_retriever` are no longer falsely flagged as disconnected during save
- **Connection schema and reference validation** (Issue #581): Added `.catchall()` to `workflowConnectionSchema` for unknown AI connection types, and extended connection reference validation to check all connection types (not just `main`)
- **autofix `filterOperationsByFixes` ID-vs-name mismatch**: Typeversion-upgrade operations now include `nodeName` alongside `nodeId`, and the filter checks both fields. Previously, `applyFixes=true` silently dropped all typeversion fixes because `fixedNodes` contained names but the filter only checked `nodeId` (UUID)

## [2.37.2] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed

- **Code validator `$()` false positive** (Issue #294): `$('Previous Node').first().json` no longer triggers "Invalid $ usage detected" warning. Added `(` and `_` to the regex negative lookahead to support standard n8n cross-node references and valid JS identifiers like `$_var`
- **Code validator helper function return false positive** (Issue #293): `function isValid(item) { return false; }` no longer triggers "Cannot return primitive values directly" error. Added helper function detection to skip primitive return checks when named functions or arrow function assignments are present
- **Null property removal in diff engine** (Issue #611): `{continueOnFail: null}` no longer causes Zod validation error "Expected boolean, received null". The diff engine now treats `null` values as property deletion (`delete` operator), and documentation updated from `undefined` to `null` for property removal

## [2.37.1] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed

- **Numeric sourceOutput remapping** (Issue #537): `addConnection` with numeric `sourceOutput` values like `"0"` or `"1"` now correctly maps to `"main"` with the corresponding `sourceIndex`, preventing malformed connection keys
- **IMAP Email Trigger activation** (Issue #538): `n8n-nodes-base.emailReadImap` and other IMAP-based polling triggers are now recognized as activatable triggers, allowing workflow activation
- **AI tool description false positives** (Issue #477): Validators now check `description` and `options.description` in addition to `toolDescription`, fixing false `MISSING_TOOL_DESCRIPTION` errors for toolWorkflow, toolCode, and toolSerpApi nodes
- **n8n_create_workflow undefined ID** (Issue #602): Added defensive check for missing workflow ID in API response with actionable error message
- **Flaky CI performance test**: Relaxed bulk insert ratio threshold from 15 to 20 to accommodate CI runner variability

## [2.37.0] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed

- **Unary operator sanitization** (Issue #592): Added missing `empty`, `notEmpty`, `exists`, `notExists` operators to the sanitizer's unary operator list, preventing IF/Switch node corruption during partial updates
- **Positional connection array preservation** (Issue #610): `removeNode` and `cleanStaleConnections` now trim only trailing empty arrays, preserving intermediate positional indices for IF/Switch multi-output nodes
- **Scoped sanitization**: Auto-sanitization now only runs on nodes that were actually added or updated, preventing unrelated nodes (e.g., HTTP Request parameters) from being silently modified
- **Activate/deactivate 415 errors** (Issue #633): Added empty body `{}` to POST calls for workflow activation/deactivation endpoints
- **Zod error readability** (Issue #630): Validation errors now return human-readable `"path: message"` strings instead of raw Zod error objects
- **updateNode error hints** (Issue #623): Improved error message when `updates` parameter is missing, showing correct structure with `nodeId`/`nodeName` and `updates` fields
- **removeConnection after removeNode** (Issue #624): When a node was already removed by a prior `removeNode` operation, the error message now explains that connections were automatically cleaned up
- **Connection type coercion** (Issue #629): `sourceOutput` and `targetInput` are now coerced to strings, handling numeric values (0, 1) passed by MCP clients

### Added

- **`saved` field in responses** (Issue #625): All `n8n_update_partial_workflow` responses now include `saved: true/false` to distinguish whether the workflow was persisted to n8n
- **Tag operations via dedicated API** (Issue #599): `addTag`/`removeTag` now use the n8n tag API (`PUT /workflows/{id}/tags`) instead of embedding tags in the workflow body, fixing silent tag failures. Includes automatic tag creation, case-insensitive name resolution, and last-operation-wins reconciliation for conflicting add/remove
- **`updateWorkflowTags` API client method**: New method on `N8nApiClient` for managing workflow tag associations via the dedicated endpoint
- **`operationsApplied` in top-level response**: Promoted from nested `details` to top-level for easier consumption by MCP clients

## [2.36.1] - 2026-03-08

### Added

- **Conditional branch fan-out detection** (`CONDITIONAL_BRANCH_FANOUT`): Warns when IF, Filter, or Switch nodes have all connections crammed into `main[0]` with higher-index outputs empty, which usually means all target nodes execute together on one branch while other branches have no effect
  - Detects IF nodes with both true/false targets on `main[0]`
  - Detects Filter nodes with both matched/unmatched targets on `main[0]`
  - Detects Switch nodes with all targets on output 0 and other outputs unused
  - Skips warning when fan-out is legitimate (higher outputs also have connections)
  - Skips warning for single connections (intentional true-only/matched-only usage)

### Changed

- **Refactored output index validation**: Extracted `getShortNodeType()` and `getConditionalOutputInfo()` helpers to eliminate duplicated conditional node detection logic between `validateOutputIndexBounds` and the new `validateConditionalBranchUsage`

## [2.36.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- **Connection validation: detect broken/malformed workflow connections** (Issue #620):
  - Unknown output keys (`UNKNOWN_CONNECTION_KEY`): Flags invalid connection keys like `"0"`, `"1"`, `"output"` with fix suggestions (e.g., "use main[1] instead" for numeric keys)
  - Invalid type field (`INVALID_CONNECTION_TYPE`): Detects invalid `type` values in connection targets (e.g., `"0"` instead of `"main"`)
  - Output index bounds checking (`OUTPUT_INDEX_OUT_OF_BOUNDS`): Catches connections using output indices beyond what a node supports, with awareness of `onError: 'continueErrorOutput'`, Switch rules, and IF/Filter nodes
  - Input index bounds checking (`INPUT_INDEX_OUT_OF_BOUNDS`): Validates target input indices against known node input counts (Merge=2, triggers=0, others=1)
  - BFS-based trigger reachability analysis: Replaces simple orphan detection with proper graph traversal from trigger nodes, flagging unreachable subgraphs
  - Flexible `WorkflowConnection` interface: Changed from explicit `main?/error?/ai_tool?` to `[outputType: string]` for accurate validation of all connection types

  - Extended `coerceStringifiedJsonParams()` to coerce every schema type: `string→number`, `string→boolean`, `number→string`, `boolean→string` (in addition to existing `string→object` and `string→array`)
  - Added top-level safeguard to parse the entire `args` object if it arrives as a JSON string
  - Added `[Diagnostic]` section to error responses showing received argument types, enabling users to report exactly what their MCP client sends
  - Added 9 new unit tests (24 total) covering number, boolean, and number-to-string coercion

## [2.35.4] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed

- **Defensive JSON.parse for stringified object/array parameters** (Issue #605): Claude Desktop 1.1.3189 serializes JSON object/array MCP parameters as strings, causing ZodError failures for ~60% of tools that accept nested parameters
  - Added schema-driven `coerceStringifiedJsonParams()` in the central `CallToolRequestSchema` handler
  - Automatically detects string values where the tool's `inputSchema` expects `object` or `array`, and parses them back
  - Safe: prefix check before parsing, type verification after, try/catch preserves original on failure
  - No-op for correct clients: native objects pass through unchanged
  - Affects 9 tools with object/array params: `validate_node`, `validate_workflow`, `n8n_create_workflow`, `n8n_update_full_workflow`, `n8n_update_partial_workflow`, `n8n_validate_workflow`, `n8n_autofix_workflow`, `n8n_test_workflow`, `n8n_executions`
  - Added 15 unit tests covering coercion, no-op, safety, and end-to-end scenarios

- **Fixed node loader for langchain package**: Adapted node loader to bypass restricted package.json `exports` field in @n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain >=2.9.0, resolving node files via absolute paths instead of `require.resolve()`
- **Fixed community doc generation for cloud LLMs**: Added `N8N_MCP_LLM_API_KEY`/`OPENAI_API_KEY` env var support, switched to `max_completion_tokens`, and auto-omit `temperature` for cloud API endpoints
- Rebuilt node database with 1,236 nodes (673 from n8n-nodes-base, 133 from @n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain, 430 community)

- **MCP Apps: Disable non-rendering apps in Claude.ai**: Disabled 3 MCP Apps (workflow-list, execution-history, health-dashboard) that render as collapsed accordions in Claude.ai, and removed `n8n_deploy_template` tool mapping which renders blank content. The server sets `_meta` correctly on the wire but the Claude.ai host ignores it for these tools. The 2 working apps (operation-result for 6 tools, validation-summary for 3 tools) remain active. Disabled apps can be re-enabled once the host-side issue is resolved.

- **MCP Apps: Fix UI not rendering for some tools in Claude**: Added legacy flat `_meta["ui/resourceUri"]` key alongside the nested `_meta.ui.resourceUri` in tool definitions. Claude.ai reads the flat key format; without it, tools like `n8n_health_check` and `n8n_list_workflows` showed as collapsed accordions instead of rendering their rich UI apps. Both key formats are now set by `injectToolMeta()`, matching the behavior of the official `registerAppTool` helper from `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps/server`.

## [2.35.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added

- **3 new MCP Apps**: workflow-list (compact table with status/tags), execution-history (status summary bar + execution table), health-dashboard (connection status, versions, performance metrics)
- **Enhanced operation-result**: operation-aware headers (create/update/delete/test/deploy), detail panels with workflow metadata, copy-to-clipboard for IDs/URLs, autofix diff viewer
- **CopyButton shared component**: reusable clipboard button with visual feedback
- **Local preview harness** (`ui-apps/preview.html`): test all 5 apps with mock data, dark/light theme toggle, JSON-RPC protocol simulation
- **Expanded shared types**: TypeScript types for workflow-list, execution-history, and health-dashboard data

### Fixed

- **React hooks violation**: Fixed `useMemo` called after early returns in `execution-history/App.tsx` and `validation-summary/App.tsx`, causing React error #310 ("Rendered more hooks than during the previous render") and blank iframes
- **JSON-RPC catch-all handler**: Preview harness responds to unknown SDK requests to prevent hangs

## [2.34.5] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed

- **MCP Apps: Fix blank UI and wrong status badge in Claude**: Rewrote `useToolData` hook to use the official `useApp` hook from `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps/react` for proper lifecycle management. Updated UI types and components to match actual server response format (`success: boolean` instead of `status: string`, nested `data` object for workflow details). Validation summary now handles both direct and wrapped (`n8n_validate_workflow`) response shapes.

## [2.34.3] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed

- **MCP Apps: Use correct MIME type for ext-apps spec**: Changed resource MIME type from `text/html` to `text/html;profile=mcp-app` (the `RESOURCE_MIME_TYPE` constant from `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps`). Without this profile parameter, Claude Desktop/web fails to recognize resources as MCP Apps and shows "Failed to load MCP App: the resource may exceed the 5 MB size limit."

Conceived by Romuald Czlonkowski - https://www.aiadvisors.pl/en

## [2.34.2] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed

- **CI: UI apps missing from npm package**: Release pipeline only ran `npm run build` (TypeScript), so `ui-apps/dist/` was never built and excluded from published packages
  - Changed build step to `npm run build:all` in `build-and-verify` and `publish-npm` jobs
  - Added `ui-apps/dist/` to npm publish staging directory
  - Added `ui-apps/dist/**/*` to published package files list

## [2.34.1] - 2026-02-07

### Changed

- **MCP Apps: Align with official ext-apps spec** for Claude Desktop/web compatibility
  - URI scheme changed from `n8n-mcp://ui/{id}` to `ui://n8n-mcp/{id}` per MCP ext-apps spec
  - `_meta.ui.resourceUri` now set on tool definitions (`tools/list`) instead of tool call responses
  - `UIMetadata.ui.app` renamed to `UIMetadata.ui.resourceUri`
  - Added `_meta` field to `ToolDefinition` type
  - Added `UIAppRegistry.injectToolMeta()` method for enriching tool definitions
  - UI apps now use `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps` `App` class instead of `window.__MCP_DATA__`
  - Updated `ReadResource` URI parser to match new `ui://` scheme

Conceived by Romuald Czlonkowski - https://www.aiadvisors.pl/en

## [2.34.0] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- **MCP Apps**: Rich HTML UIs rendered by MCP hosts alongside tool results via `_meta.ui` and the MCP resources protocol
  - Server-side UI module (`src/mcp/ui/`) with tool-to-UI mapping and `_meta.ui` injection
  - `UIAppRegistry` static class for loading and serving self-contained HTML apps
  - `UI_APP_CONFIGS` mapping tools to their corresponding UI apps

- **Operation Result UI**: Visual summary for workflow operation tools
  - Status badge, operation type, workflow details card
  - Expandable sections for nodes added, modified, and removed
  - Mapped to: `n8n_create_workflow`, `n8n_update_full_workflow`, `n8n_update_partial_workflow`, `n8n_delete_workflow`, `n8n_test_workflow`, `n8n_autofix_workflow`, `n8n_deploy_template`

- **Validation Summary UI**: Visual summary for validation tools
  - Valid/invalid badge with error and warning counts
  - Expandable error list with type, property, message, and fix
  - Expandable warning list and suggestions
  - Mapped to: `validate_node`, `validate_workflow`, `n8n_validate_workflow`

- **React + Vite Build Pipeline** (`ui-apps/`):
  - React 19, Vite 6, vite-plugin-singlefile for self-contained HTML output
  - Shared component library: Card, Badge, Expandable
  - `useToolData` hook for reading data from `window.__MCP_DATA__` or embedded JSON
  - n8n-branded dark theme with CSS custom properties
  - Per-app builds via `APP_NAME` environment variable

- **MCP Resources Protocol**: Server now exposes `resources` capability
  - `ListResources` handler returns available UI apps
  - `ReadResource` handler serves self-contained HTML via `n8n-mcp://ui/{id}` URIs

- **New Scripts**:
  - `build:ui`: Build UI apps (`cd ui-apps && npm install && npm run build`)
  - `build:all`: Build UI apps then server (`npm run build:ui && npm run build`)

### Changed

- **MCP Server**: Added `resources: {}` to server capabilities alongside existing `tools: {}`
- **Tool Responses**: Tools with matching UI apps now include `_meta.ui.app` URI pointing to their visual representation
- **Graceful Degradation**: Server starts and operates normally without `ui-apps/dist/`; UI metadata is only injected when HTML is available

Conceived by Romuald Czlonkowski - https://www.aiadvisors.pl/en

## [2.33.6] - 2026-02-06

### Changed

- Updated n8n from 2.4.4 to 2.6.3

- Updated README badge with new n8n version

## [2.33.5] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed

- **Critical memory leak: per-session database connections** (Issue #542): Fixed severe memory leak where each MCP session created its own database connection (~900MB per session)
  - Root cause: `N8NDocumentationMCPServer` called `createDatabaseAdapter()` for every new session, duplicating the entire 68MB database in memory
  - With 3-4 sessions, memory would exceed 4GB causing OOM kills every ~20 minutes
  - Fix: Implemented singleton `SharedDatabase` pattern - all sessions now share ONE database connection
  - Memory impact: Reduced from ~900MB per session to ~68MB total (shared) + ~5MB per session overhead
  - Added `getSharedDatabase()` and `releaseSharedDatabase()` for thread-safe connection management
  - Added reference counting to track active sessions using the shared connection

- **Session timeout optimization**: Reduced default session timeout from 30 minutes to 5 minutes
  - Faster cleanup of stale sessions reduces memory buildup
  - Configurable via `SESSION_TIMEOUT_MINUTES` environment variable

- **Eager instance cleanup**: When a client reconnects, previous sessions for the same instanceId are now immediately cleaned up
  - Prevents memory accumulation from reconnecting clients in multi-tenant deployments

- **Telemetry event listener leak**: Fixed event listeners in `TelemetryBatchProcessor` that were never removed
  - Added proper cleanup in `stop()` method
  - Added guard against multiple `start()` calls

### Added

- **New module: `src/database/shared-database.ts`** - Singleton database manager
  - `getSharedDatabase(dbPath)`: Thread-safe initialization with promise lock pattern
  - `releaseSharedDatabase(state)`: Reference counting for cleanup
  - `closeSharedDatabase()`: Graceful shutdown for process termination
  - `isSharedDatabaseInitialized()` and `getSharedDatabaseRefCount()`: Monitoring helpers

### Changed

- **`N8NDocumentationMCPServer.close()`**: Now releases shared database reference instead of closing the connection
- **`SingleSessionHTTPServer.shutdown()`**: Calls `closeSharedDatabase()` during graceful shutdown

## [2.33.4] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed

- **Memory leak in SSE session reset** (Issue #542): Fixed memory leak when SSE sessions are recreated every 5 minutes
  - Root cause: `resetSessionSSE()` only closed the transport but not the MCP server
  - This left the SimpleCache cleanup timer (60-second interval) running indefinitely
  - Database connections and cached data (~50-100MB per session) persisted in memory
  - Fix: Added `server.close()` call before `transport.close()`, mirroring the existing cleanup pattern in `removeSession()`
  - Impact: Prevents ~288 leaked server instances per day in long-running HTTP deployments

## [2.33.3] - 2026-01-21

### Changed

- **Updated n8n dependencies to latest versions**
  - n8n: 2.3.3 → 2.4.4
  - n8n-core: 2.3.2 → 2.4.2
  - n8n-workflow: 2.3.2 → 2.4.2
  - @n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain: 2.3.2 → 2.4.3

### Added

- **New `icon` property type**: Added support for the new `icon` NodePropertyType introduced in n8n 2.4.x
  - Added type structure definition in `src/constants/type-structures.ts`
  - Updated type count from 22 to 23 NodePropertyTypes
  - Updated related tests to reflect the new type

### Fixed

- Rebuilt node database with 803 nodes (541 from n8n-nodes-base, 262 from @n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain)

## [2.33.2] - 2026-01-13

### Changed

  - @n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain: 2.2.2 → 2.3.2
  - Rebuilt node database with 537 nodes (434 from n8n-nodes-base, 103 from @n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain)
  - Updated README badge with new n8n version

## [2.33.1] - 2026-01-12

### Fixed

- **Docker image version mismatch bug**: Docker images were built with stale `package.runtime.json` (v2.29.5) while npm package was at v2.33.0
  - Root cause: `build-docker` job in `release.yml` did not sync `package.runtime.json` version before building
  - The `publish-npm` job synced the version, but both jobs ran in parallel, so Docker got the stale version
  - Added "Sync runtime version" step to `release.yml` `build-docker` job
  - Added "Sync runtime version" step to `docker-build.yml` `build` and `build-railway` jobs
  - All Docker builds now sync `package.runtime.json` version from `package.json` before building

## [2.33.0] - 2026-01-08
